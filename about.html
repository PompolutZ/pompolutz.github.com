                <h2>About</h2>

                <p>I'm 26 years old and currently working in Tobii AB in Kyiv's development office. In our OEM team we do bunch of experining stuff, creating different prototypes, experimental or internal projects using Tobii's eye-trackers.</p>
<p>My professional interests concentrated around WPF right now, both at work and home project. Also since I've started making this personal page I am reading <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" title="Learn you a Haskell for a great good">Learn you a Haskell for a great good</a> in a bus during my trip to work, trying to get what those Functors and Applicative Functors are, and put more power to control my blog in my hands.</p>
<p>I'm thinking in start learing JS again. Because so many people reccomends this.</p>
